# _Responsive Design Pattern Practice - Mondrian Template_

#### Week 2 Project - 2

#### By **Rose Sponseller and Kristen McKee, May 31, 2017**

## Description

In this project, we practiced responsive design breakpoints by creating a Mondrian-esque template.  The site features three images. Once it becomes too narrow for the initial state though the widescreen layout adapts and becomes a vertical layout. This layout then breaks down to our standard single column mobile view where each piece of content is simply stacked under the last.
